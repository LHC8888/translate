  <p>给这个页面的布局视口宽度设置为200px</p>
  <p>可以使用 document.documentElement.clientWidth 来获取布局视口的宽度 </p>
  <p>You can set the layout viewport’s width to any dimension you want, including device-width. That last one takes screen.width (in device pixels) as its reference and resizes the layout viewport accordingly.

    There’s a catch here, though. Sometimes the formal screen.width does not make much sense because the pixel count is just too high. For instance, the Nexus One has a formal width of 480px, but Google engineers have decided that giving the layout viewport a width of 480px when using device-width is just too much. They shrank it to 2/3rds, so that device-width gives you a width of 320px, just as on the iPhone.</p>
